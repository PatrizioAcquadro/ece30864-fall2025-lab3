Q1(a) Agile vs non-Agile – 2 Pros & 2 Cons
Pros of Agile (vs Waterfall):
1) Iterative delivery with constant customer collaboration: value is delivered continuously, not just at the end. 
2) More resilient to changing scope and priorities during the project.
Cons of Agile (vs Waterfall):
1) Less upfront predictability of exact scope/schedule/cost (because scope can change during iterations).
2) Requires steady, ongoing engagement from stakeholders and the team, which can be hard to maintain.

Q1(b) Scrum Master vs Product Owner – roles & responsibilities
Scrum Master:
- Facilitates Scrum events (planning, daily scrum, review, retro).
- Removes impediments, coaches the team, manages Jira/Scrum tooling.
Product Owner:
- Owns product vision and backlog; sets direction and priorities for value.
- Manages releases and stakeholder communication; accepts/rejects work.

Q1(c) Three meetings in a sprint (+ two points each)
1) Sprint Planning
   - Define Sprint Goal and select stories from backlog into sprint.
   - Estimate/story points and plan capacity/initial task breakdown.
2) Daily Scrum (Stand-up)
   - Share progress since last day; plan for the next 24 hours.
   - Surface blockers/risks early; keep team aligned (≈10 minutes).
3) Sprint Review & Retrospective
   - Review/demo completed work; move incomplete work back to backlog.
   - Inspect process, agree improvement actions; close the sprint.
