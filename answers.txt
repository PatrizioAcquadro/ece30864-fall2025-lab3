Q1(a) Agile vs non-Agile – 2 Pros & 2 Cons
Pros of Agile (vs Waterfall):
1) Iterative delivery with constant customer collaboration: value is delivered continuously, not just at the end. 
2) More resilient to changing scope and priorities during the project.
Cons of Agile (vs Waterfall):
1) Less upfront predictability of exact scope/schedule/cost (because scope can change during iterations).
2) Requires steady, ongoing engagement from stakeholders and the team, which can be hard to maintain.
